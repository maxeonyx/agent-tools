## TDD ratchet — read before testing

Run `cargo ratchet`, not plain `cargo test`. A new test must be red when first introduced and committed as `pending`; that expected red test keeps CI green. A new test must not pass when first introduced—doing so makes the ratchet and CI red. Implement only after the red commit, then rerun the ratchet and commit the promotion to `passing`.
